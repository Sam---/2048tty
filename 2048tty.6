.SH DESCRIPTION
.B 2048tty
is an implementation of Gabriele Cirulli's "2048" using Python and curses. It
uses

style keys to control the tiles.
The game consists of a four-by-four grid, each cell holding a number. The
object of the game is to merge tiles until a 2048 tile is produced.

out of debug mode, simply press 'd' a second time.
