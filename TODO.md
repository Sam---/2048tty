# Todo

1. Add a `TileJoin` animation that shows the joined tile when done.
2. Change `TileSpawn` to show the tile expanding, instead of the current barely
noticable tumble.
3. Add a grid.
4. Use arrow keys and quit on escape.
5. Mouse support?
6. Refactor all the code to use `Coord`.
7. Add win/lose detection.
8. Refactor `Grid` to reduce code duplication.
9. Add different shades of yellow, possibly truecolor?
10. Man page.
